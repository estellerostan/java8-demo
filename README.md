# java8-demo

Basic demonstration of Java 8 stream and lambda features by implementing a REST Client using Unirest.  
You can find the relevant examples [here](https://github.com/estellerostan/java8-demo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mbds/java8demo/LibraryBookClient.java).

## About the REST Web Service
It was created for my Master's course "Web Services REST". The assignment is to implement the classic Library-Book example using the Grails framework.

 ## About the REST Client
After getting the REST Web Service responses about the books and libraries, we can implement functionalities like searching a book in a library, transferring books from one library to another, ... in a Java 8 style.

### This is a Java 8 demo, why is there only a few java 8 features implemented?!
This is an ongoing project, I have yet to do all of what I planned! 

Please come back later to see the full demo :relaxed:

### Why a REST Client? Why don't you just create dummy data for the demo?
I like to see what I can do with a school assignment, giving it a purpose so it becomes more than just a project we do because we are told to is satisfying.
